Read me for using pretrained model multiclass
_______

The functions have all been commented and the functionality
can be guaged from that.

Do not run the my_main_unet.py file if you are not training from scratch.
The weights are already saved and can be used in my_test.py

I would recommend you to download the weights from eye in the sky repository of manideep2510 and try again.

This is just a base code and can be used for testing. No transfer learning or anything has been used.
